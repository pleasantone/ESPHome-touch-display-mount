ESPHome powered Home Assistant control panel using the popular Cheap Yellow Display (ESP32-2432S028).

A 3D-printable enclosure with adjustable tilt for an ESP32 2.8" ILI9341 touchscreen, powered by ESPHome + LVGL and integrated with Home Assistant.  
Includes ready-to-flash YAML configs for the ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display) and a standalone ILI9341 + external ESP32 wiring variant.

Multiple mounting options are supported:

- Desk Mount – for tabletop installation
- Under-Desk Mount – for installation underneath a desk or shelf
- Wall Mount – for wall installation (CYD version only)
- Flush Mount – for in-wall installation (EU electrical box compatible)

The enclosure can therefore be used as a compact Home Assistant control panel for desks, walls, or mounted underneath furniture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ESP32-2432S028 Cheap Yellow Display is transformed into a tiltable Home Assistant control panel powered by ESPHome and LVGL.

The goal of this project is to create a clean, wall- or desk-mounted smart control panel that integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant.  
It features a modern LVGL-based UI, real-time state synchronization, and optional direct Home Assistant service calls.

The enclosure is designed for:

- Clean cable routing  
- Adjustable viewing angle (±35° tilt)  
- Minimal footprint  
- Professional, integrated appearance  

Two hardware variants are supported:

- ✅ **ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display / CYD)**
- ✅ **Standalone ILI9341 + External ESP32 wiring variant**

The ESP32-2432S028 integrates the ESP32, ILI9341 display, touchscreen controller, and backlight circuitry on a single board.  
It is commonly known as the **Cheap Yellow Display (CYD)** in the maker community and is the easiest option for this project.

Some CYD boards use an ILI9342 panel. The existing CYD home-like YAML contains complete display/orientation presets for both ILI9341 and ILI9342; ILI9341 at 0 degrees remains active by default. USB connector type alone does not identify the controller. See the [hardware selection notes](esphome/home-like/README.md#picking-your-hardware-variant).

## Demo
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68709d8e-21ec-4851-bf73-70f583027390

Note: The video quality looks worse than in real life because the display refresh rate interferes with the camera frame rate when filming the screen. In reality the UI looks much smoother and cleaner.

# 🆕 Architecture Overview (LVGL-Based UI)

This project uses ESPHome LVGL instead of a classic display lambda approach.

### Core Concepts

- UI rendered fully using LVGL widgets
- 4 configurable touch buttons
- Real-time state mirroring from Home Assistant
- Central `ui_refresh` script keeps UI synchronized
- Optional direct Home Assistant service calls
- Action sensor for automation-based control

### Two Control Modes

#### 1️⃣ Direct Mode (Default – Plug & Play)

If `DIRECT_ACTIONS` is set to `"true"` (default):

- Touch publishes an action string
- AND directly calls a Home Assistant service  
  (default: `light.toggle`)

No Home Assistant automations required.

#### 2️⃣ Automation Mode

If `DIRECT_ACTIONS` is set to `"false"`:

- Touch ONLY publishes an action string
- You implement behavior in Home Assistant automations

Trigger example:
```
Entity: sensor.smartdisplay_action
To: btn1_press
```

### Overlay Control Layer

The UI contains a secondary overlay layer used for interactive controls.

When a tile is long-pressed:

1. The overlay opens
2. The control type is determined (brightness / percentage / cover position / climate temperature)
3. For color-capable lights, the brightness overlay can open a color/temperature picker
4. Slider interaction updates Home Assistant
5. Closing the overlay returns to the tile grid

This keeps the tile UI clean while still allowing detailed control.


# ⚙️ Requirements

- Home Assistant installed
- ESPHome Add-on installed
- **ESPHome 2026.9.0 or newer** is required by encrypted OTA in all four configs. Existing devices need the [OTA migration](#encrypted-ota-and-migration) before using the final config wirelessly.
- Home Assistant 2026.2+
- Basic ESPHome knowledge
- 3D printer access (optional)

---

# 🧪 Tested With

The current home-like integration was hardware-tested with:

- **ESPHome 2026.9.0** and **Home Assistant 2026.2+**
- ESP32-2432S028 (Cheap Yellow Display / CYD) with ILI9341
- all existing tile actions and overlays, localized OFF confirmation, auto-dim/wake, touch alignment and encrypted OTA migration

Earlier releases were also tested on the standalone ILI9341 + XPT2046 wiring variant. The ILI9342 contribution author reported testing all four orientations; the integrated ILI9342 profile has not been independently hardware-verified by the maintainer.

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT -- Enable "Actions" in Home Assistant

Because this project uses:

```
homeassistant.action → light.toggle
```

You must allow the ESPHome device to perform Home Assistant service calls.

### How to enable:

1. Open Home Assistant  
2. Go to **Settings**  
3. Click **Devices & Services**  
4. Open the **ESPHome integration**  
5. Select your device  
6. Enable:

> "Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions"

Without this setting, direct control will not work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Power connection (CYD)

For the mount enclosure the side USB connector of the CYD is **not used**.

Instead the included power cable can be used.  
The **red and black wires provide 5V and GND** and can easily be connected to an old USB-A cable.

Typical setup:

1. Cut an old USB cable
2. Connect **5V (red)** and **GND (black)** to the CYD power cable
3. Route the cable through the enclosure
4. Solder or use small wire connectors

This keeps the enclosure compact and avoids having a visible or protruding USB connector on the side.

If the USB port was used directly, the enclosure would need to be wider or the connector would remain visible.

⚠️ Important: The CYD often has multiple identical JST connectors, but they do not share the same pinout. Make sure to use the connector labeled VIN / 5V. Other connectors may be labeled 3.3V, and connecting 5V there can damage the board.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🚀 Installation

1.  Open ESPHome in Home Assistant
2.  Create a new device
3.  Copy the appropriate YAML file
4.  Edit the **USER CONFIG / substitutions** section at the top of the YAML (entities, labels, icons)
5.  Copy `esphome/secrets.yaml.example` to `secrets.yaml` **in the same directory as the chosen YAML** and fill in your credentials
6.  Flash the device; for an existing password-based installation, follow [OTA migration](#encrypted-ota-and-migration)

Available YAML variants (pick **one UI** for your **hardware**):

> **ESPHome version:** all configs require **ESPHome 2026.9.0+**. The current CYD home-like configuration has been verified on ILI9341 hardware; see [Tested With](#-tested-with) for the remaining hardware scope.

### Cheap Yellow Display (ESP32-2432S028 / CYD)
- `esphome/home-like/cyd-2432s028/home-like.yaml` – 2x3 “tiles” UI (wallpaper + tiles) — actively maintained
- `esphome/buttons/cyd-2432s028/buttons.yaml` – lockscreen with 4 round buttons (simple / legacy)

### External display wiring (any ESP32 + ILI9341 + XPT2046)
- `esphome/home-like/ili9341-external-esp32/home-like.yaml` – 2x3 “tiles” UI (wallpaper + tiles) — actively maintained
- `esphome/buttons/ili9341-external-esp32/buttons.yaml` – lockscreen with 4 round buttons (simple / legacy)

> Tip: The `home-like.yaml` file downloads orientation-specific background images at build time from a pinned repository revision.
> For a full reference of all tile substitutions and copy-paste examples, see [`esphome/home-like/TILE_CONFIGURATION.md`](esphome/home-like/TILE_CONFIGURATION.md).
> Two images are included:
> - `smartdisplay_background.png` — used for 0° (landscape) and 180° (landscape flipped)
> - `smartdisplay_background_90.png` — used for 90° (portrait) and 270° (portrait flipped)
>
> The active image is selected via the `BG_IMAGE` substitution in the ORIENTATION preset block.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assets (downloaded at build time)

The icon font and home-like wallpapers download during compilation, so they do not need to be copied alongside the YAML for the default setup. Credentials still belong in `secrets.yaml` next to that YAML. Existing Google Fonts entries also need network access at build time.

- **Material Design Icons font**: `MDI_FONT_URL` points to `materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf` at release **v7.4.47** of [Templarian/MaterialDesign-Webfont](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Webfont) (Apache 2.0).
  - If you change icons in the YAML, ensure the glyph list contains them.
- **Background images (home-like UI)**:
  - `esphome/home-like/images/smartdisplay_background.png` — landscape (0° and 180°), included.
  - `esphome/home-like/images/smartdisplay_background_90.png` — portrait (90° and 270°), included.
  - Selected automatically via the `BG_IMAGE` substitution in the ORIENTATION preset block.
  - `ASSET_BASE` is pinned to public commit `9ffa5dfddf695150ad0388f5f5e2bcf786772195`, under `esphome/home-like`, so it does not follow changes on `main`.

For local home-like assets, copy that UI's `images/` and `fonts/` folders next to the chosen YAML and set these substitutions:

```yaml
ASSET_BASE: '.'
MDI_FONT_URL: 'fonts/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf'
```

The buttons UI only needs the font override and local `fonts/` folder; it has no wallpaper. These overrides do not replace the Google Fonts downloads.

### Encrypted OTA and migration

Current configs use `ota: - platform: esphome` with `encryption:`, inheriting `smartdisplay_api_key` from API encryption. Keep the existing API key.

For firmware that only supports password-based OTA, use **two wireless installs** with ESPHome 2026.9.x:

1. In your local config, temporarily replace OTA `encryption:` with `password: !secret ota_password`. Keep the existing password in the adjacent `secrets.yaml` and API encryption enabled. Install, reboot, and verify the log says `Encryption: offered, plaintext accepted`.
2. Replace OTA `password:` with the bare `encryption:` block below, then install again. Verify `Encryption: required`. Subsequent OTA updates use encryption; the unused OTA password secret can now be removed.

```yaml
ota:
  - platform: esphome
    encryption:
```

Do not combine OTA `password:` and `encryption:`. The first transfer to old firmware is plaintext. Alternatively, install the final encrypted config directly over USB/serial. See [ESPHome's migration instructions](https://esphome.io/components/ota/esphome/#enabling-encryption-on-an-existing-device).

# ⚙️ UI mapping (USER CONFIG)

Your config choice defines the UI style:

## `buttons.yaml` (lockscreen like buttons)
- Buttons: BTN1..BTN4
- Action strings: `btn1_press` .. `btn4_press`
- Default direct action (if `DIRECT_ACTIONS: "true"`): `light.toggle` on `BTN*_ENTITY`

<img src="images/display-buttons.png" width="50%">


## `home-like.yaml` (tiles)
- Tiles: TILE1..TILE6
- Action strings: `tile1_press` .. `tile6_press` (short tap), `tile1_long_press` .. `tile6_long_press` (long press)
- Each tile can optionally call a Home Assistant service directly (e.g. light toggle, fan preset toggle, cover open/close, cover position, or climate target temperature).
- Per-tile OFF label is configurable via `TILE*_LABEL_OFF` (e.g. "Off" / "Aus").
- Optional `TILEn_CONFIRM_OFF: "true"` guards short taps that would turn off or close a supported entity; the default is `"false"`. Cancellation emits no event and performs no action. Acceptance publishes `tileN_confirmed_off` and performs an explicit off/close action instead of a toggle. See [supported actions and limitations](esphome/home-like/TILE_CONFIGURATION.md#short-tap-off-confirmation), including automation-only mode and unprotected long presses.

### Long-Press Behavior

Each tile's long-press mode is configured via `TILE*_LONGPRESS`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `slider` | Opens a value overlay (brightness / fan speed / cover position / climate temperature) |
| `action` | Fires a different HA entity than the short tap |
| `none` | Only publishes the `tileN_long_press` event, no direct action |

**Slider mode** — configure with `TILE*_LONGPRESS_SLIDER` and `TILE*_LONGPRESS_OFF_VALUE`:

| Tile Type | Overlay Control |
|-----------|----------------|
| light     | Brightness slider; color/temperature picker when supported by the HA light entity |
| fan       | Speed / percentage slider |
| cover     | Position slider |
| climate   | Thermostat ring for target temperature |

**Action mode** — configure with `TILE*_LONGPRESS_ACTION`, `TILE*_LONGPRESS_ACTION_TYPE`, and optionally `TILE*_LONGPRESS_ACTION_SERVICE`. The action entity can be a completely different entity than the short tap target — useful for e.g. triggering a scene or script on long press while toggling a light on short press.

In all modes, the `tileN_long_press` event is always published to `sensor.smartdisplay_action` so Home Assistant automations can react to it independently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧠 System Flow

### Direct Mode

For a guarded home-like short tap that would switch an entity off, confirmation happens before step 2. Acceptance publishes `tileN_confirmed_off`; cancellation stops the flow.

1. Button pressed  
2. Action string published  
3. Home Assistant service called  
4. Entity state updated  
5. Mirrored back into ESPHome  
6. UI refreshed  

### Automation Mode

The same short-tap gate replaces the normal event with `tileN_confirmed_off` after acceptance. The automation must handle that event with an explicit off/close service, not a toggle.

1. Button pressed  
2. Action string published  
3. Home Assistant automation triggers  
4. Automation controls device  
5. State mirrored back  


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔧 Customization

For most setups, you only need to edit the **USER CONFIG / substitutions** section in the YAML.

You can also:

-   Add more buttons / pages
-   Change service calls (the default is `light.toggle`)
-   Modify fonts and icon glyphs
-   Adjust colors / theme
-   Date localization can be adjusted in the ui_refresh script (days[] / months[] arrays).
-   Adjust transforms for your panel

For home-like touch alignment, use the matching hardware profile and ORIENTATION preset first. LVGL rotates the display and touch coordinates together; touchscreen transforms correct the controller's native axes and do not need to match a display transform. Tune `TOUCH_CAL_*` for your panel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Troubleshooting

### White screen after ESPHome update (2026.4+)

If the display stays **completely white** after updating ESPHome but the device still connects to Home Assistant, the cause is a breaking change in ESPHome 2026.4: the `ili9xxx` display platform was deprecated in favor of `mipi_spi`.

The current configs use `mipi_spi` and require ESPHome 2026.9.0+ for encrypted OTA. Upgrade the builder and follow the OTA migration above; reverting only the display platform does not make these configs compatible with older releases.

---

### Corrupted / garbled display output

If the display shows **corrupted graphics, horizontal lines, or random pixels**, the most common cause is a **different display controller on your Cheap Yellow Display**.

Most CYD boards use **ILI9341**, but some variants ship with **ST7789** or **ILI9342**.  
If the driver in ESPHome does not match the controller, the display output may look broken.

For a confirmed ILI9342 panel, use the existing `esphome/home-like/cyd-2432s028/home-like.yaml`. In **DISPLAY / ORIENTATION PRESETS**, comment out the active ILI9341 block and uncomment one complete ILI9342 block for the required orientation. No separate ILI9342 YAML is needed and no calculated substitutions are involved.

Diagonal stripes can indicate a mismatch between the native panel dimensions and driver. Check the board/controller information; neither that symptom nor a USB-C/Micro-USB connector arrangement is definitive identification. ST7789 boards need a separately verified configuration and are not covered by the ILI9341/ILI9342 selector. The selector applies to the CYD home-like config, not the buttons or external-wiring variants.

### `Invalid offsets.` / won't compile on ESPHome 2026.6+

If validation fails on the `dimensions:` line of the display with:

```
display.mipi_spi: Invalid offsets.
```

this is the ESPHome 2026.6 change to `mipi_spi`: a `transform:` block on the display combined with swapped (rotated) `dimensions:` is no longer accepted. **The configs in this repo are already fixed for this** — rotation is now handled by LVGL:

- the display is driven at its **native** size (240 × 320 for ILI9341; 320 × 240 for ILI9342) with **no** rotation transform on the display
- rotation is set via `LVGL_ROTATION` in the chosen ORIENTATION preset, which feeds `rotation:` in the `lvgl:` block (LVGL rotates the display **and** the touch coordinates together)

If you copied an older YAML, update your device configuration, compile with ESPHome 2026.9.0+, and install it using the appropriate migration path above.

### Display rotated / mirrored

If the UI appears **rotated, mirrored, or upside down**, use the built-in **DISPLAY / ORIENTATION PRESETS** in the substitutions section at the top of `home-like.yaml`.

The CYD home-like config provides eight complete presets: four orientations for ILI9341 and four for ILI9342. Uncomment exactly one complete block and comment out all others. The external ILI9341 config continues to provide its four orientation presets.

> Note: touch calibration values (`TOUCH_CAL_*`) are device-specific. The presets include approximate values that may need tuning after flashing.

**LVGL manages rotation** for both the display and the touchscreen. Do not add display rotation to compensate for touch alignment; use the matching profile and preset. The resulting rotation is supplied through `LVGL_ROTATION`:

```yaml
# in the active display/orientation preset
LVGL_ROTATION: "90"   # 0 / 90 / 180 / 270
```

If touch is mirrored or axes are swapped relative to the display, check the touchscreen axis correction for your selected controller. These values correct raw XPT2046 coordinates against the native panel; the ILI9341 example below is not a universal ILI9342 profile:

```yaml
TOUCH_SWAP_XY: "false"
TOUCH_MIRROR_X: "true"
TOUCH_MIRROR_Y: "false"
```

After changing a display/orientation preset, verify touch targets and calibration on the physical panel. Current configs require ESPHome 2026.9.0+.
